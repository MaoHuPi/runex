1. simplify(calculate)
2. take approximations(calc irrational numbers, but not imaginary numbers)
	simplify 1
	symbol get value
	simplify 2

add, simplest => polynomial
sub, simplest => polynomial
mul, simplest => term
div, simplest => fraction

algebra with number => substituted
algebra, constant(irrational numbers), <s>imaginary numbers</s>
